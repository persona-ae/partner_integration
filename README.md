# Persona Avatar Integration

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰  

This repository provides everything you need to **embed and integrate the Persona Avatar pixel-streaming app** into your own mobile apps, web apps, or backend services. Our goal is to make it straightforward for partners to deliver rich, real-time avatar experiences to their users while keeping integration secure, reliable, and flexible.

## What is the Persona Avatar Pixel-Streaming App?

The Persona Avatar app is a low-latency, WebRTC-based experience that streams interactive avatars directly to your client. It is designed to:

- Render high-fidelity avatars in real time using Unreal Engine + Pixel Streaming.  
- Connect seamlessly to your backend systems using our APIs and secure tokens.  
- Run inside your own **mobile apps** (via WebViews), **websites** (via iframes or script tags), or any environment with a modern browser.  
- Provide hooks and callbacks so you can track sessions, customize behavior, and deliver personalized experiences.
